var let and Const difference???
 Must read --->  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/
 
Closure:Suppose we have one function inside one other function so all the variables and functions can be accesssed inside the inner function.
like in fetching


Difference between onClick={handleClick} & onClick={handleClick()}---> Since functions are first class citizens in JavaScript, they are invoked as soon as they are mounted. So handleClick() will run even without any click event happening.


()=>{} ---> Must be defined before they are used as they are not hoisted. Arrow functions do not have their own this, so are not well suited for defining object methods.


Function arguments are passed by value so the changes in arguments value is not reflected outside the function.
But Objects are passed by reference. So, if function changes objects value, it changes the original value. So that change will be reflected outside function as well.
